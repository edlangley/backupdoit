#Backupdoit

Backupdoit is a simple utility to back up your actions from doit.im.

[doit.im](http://doit.im/) is a web service which provides a system for implementing the [GTD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done) method of time-management.

GTD requires that all your actions/to-dos be recorded in a trusted system. In order to trust doit.im (Or any other web based software for that matter) there must be a way to backup the data recorded in it to somewhere else. A backup feature is not provided by doit as is, so this is my attempt at just such a tool. The data from your doit.im account is retrieved and can be backed up to either a list in a text file or raw JSON format.

Backupdoit is written in QtQuick and Qt using C++. It was a convenient excuse for me to learn all about QML.
